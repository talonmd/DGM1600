# Personal Portfolio - Talon Durrant - DGM 1600

This is my Personal Portfolio Project for DGM 1600. It contains a few projects that function with JavaScript.

Here is a description of the three assignments and the features they display.

All assignments demonstrate:
* examples of Basic JavaScript (variables, string manipulation, arrays, etc)
* use of arrow functions
* use of strings and template literals
* iteration through arrays with for loops
* objects and properties being accessed with dot notation

## Star Wars Planets

Star Wars Planets lets the user choose a climate by clicking a button. It then displays only the planets with that chosen climate.

This assignment specifically uses:
* import and export statements
* buttons and event listeners
* filtering and attribute changes

## Pokemon Cards

Pokemon Cards displays pokemon in a card format that the user can click to flip over, for more information. The user can also search for a pokemon by it's ID number, and the new object will be created and displayed on a card. Additionally, the user can generate a random pokemon card, which uses random number generation to show different pictured creatures.

This assignment specifically uses:
* object declarations
* custom JavaScript objects
* objects and constructors
* arrow functions

## Senators & Votes

Senators and Votes simply displays the current U.S. Senators in a card format and gives some information, such as age and votes cast, to the viewer. At the top it displays how many votes each party has cast in total.

This assignment specifically uses:
* arrays to store and manipulate data
* objects with key-value pairs
* filtering, mapping, and reducing
